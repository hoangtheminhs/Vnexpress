Denmark uses many digital tools in the past. Children use phones and screens at school. Now adults see problems. Children feel stressed. They cannot think clearly.

Many children use phones for five hours a day. This is bad for learning and health. Children in schools now cannot use their phones. They give phones to teachers each morning. Paper books return to class. Clubs and sports places also stop using phones. Children talk more and play more together.

Denmark also plans new rules. Children under fifteen may not use social media. Parents and teachers are happy with this change. They want children to be healthy and happy.
